<p>
  Ali is our content expert!
</p>

<p>
  She has worked on content strategy and has lots of hands-on experience in managing and delivering content.
</p>

<p>  
  She enjoys taking ideas right through from concept to delivery and has a very common sense approach to any project - always looking for practical, achievable and cost effective ways to deliver creative content
</p>

<p>
In her previous role as Head of Content for Tui UK, she managed the Content and Publishing team responsible for the Thomson and First Choice brands. The team encompassed editorial, photography, filming, design, content management, content delivery and content IT. She managed a broad range of projects that include tone of voice, visual style, re-designs, re-branding, content strategy, content development, content migration, business process reviews and content systems implementations. So she definitely has all the skills to tackle even the most challenging of projects.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, her role as Creative Manager for a successful greeting card publisher gave Ali invaluable exposure to being a key part of a smaller team and some very useful hands-on experience.
