      <p>The Red Engine team produced this film for the Michelin-starred Galvin La Chapelle restaurant, Spital Square, London E1.</p>
      <p>Our brief was to showcase the Galvin brand - to capture the restaurant’s quality, atmosphere and expertise, as well as communicating their mentoring and team approach to delivering excellent food and outstanding service. We also got to meet and film Jeff Galvin himself.</p>
      <p>It was fascinating, observing the team at work - the preparation of dishes, the mixing of drinks, the serving of customers, the sharing of knowledge – a really nurturing and friendly atmosphere.</p>
      <p>We were kept going with coffee on tap, and a brunch-time treat of the best lemon soufflé we’ve ever tasted – although we did have to share it!</p>
      <p>It was also a fantastic opportunity to enjoy the surroundings of Galvin La Chapelle. This Grade 2 listed building was constructed in 1890 as a parish hall and school, and originally part of a much larger site - and was luckily saved from demolition by local residents in 1976/77, after the school relocated a year earlier. It was lovingly restored and opened as a restaurant in 2009.</p>
