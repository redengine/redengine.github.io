      <p>The visual’s needed to be developed in a modular way, allowing there to be flexibility with rolling the designs out across multiple sites’ and geographical locations.</p>
      <p>The Illustrations and plans were created using templates for an interchangeable approach on colours, images and layouts.</p>
      <p>Initial ideas were sketched by hand – these were then developed into fully rendered 3D outcomes using computer generated software techniques and processes.</p>
      <p>The following images show initial sketches, blank templates and completed outcomes.</p>
