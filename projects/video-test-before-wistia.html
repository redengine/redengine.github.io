      <p>Holidays are about moments, adventures, exploring, relaxing, tastes, aromas, having fun… Our job was to capture this on film.</p>
      <p>Our challenge was to tell a holiday brand’s story, capture an essence and a mood, and provide a visual glimpse of an experience and/or a destination.</p>
      <p>From family holidays to couples’ only breaks, from cultural experiences to natural wonders – whatever the holiday product our crews caught it.</p>
      <p>Delivering this required us to be on-call dawn to dusk, waiting on the weather and for the most interesting light (especially those golden hours of sunrise or sunset), looking after models and crew, whilst making sure that holidaymakers weren’t inconvenience at all!</p>
      <p>This showreel includes footage from the Maldives, Egypt, Cyprus and Turkey.</p>
