<p>During the Bowie By O’Neill project, artists’ were asked to submit illustrative work inspired by Terry O’Neill’s extensive archive. This limited edition (unframed) screenprint, by Sue Jarman, was created from a mixed media illustration, in 3 colours - in an edition of 25.</p>

<p>This Fine Art book includes never-before and rarely seen photos from a nearly thirty year partnership, and includes images from the last Ziggy Stardust performance, the studio recording session for Young Americans, stage performances from Station to Station, set photography from The Man Who Fell to Earth and the now iconic photo session for Diamond Dogs. Included in this book for the first time are images from the lost David Bowie and William Burroughs sessions, a packet of negatives recently recovered during the production of this book.</p>
