<p>So far it’s been a summer filled with creative inspiration, and two new publications…</p>

<p>Firstly, inspiration, and the annual spectacular where art and design colleges open their doors and showcase their latest graduates’ work is always a highlight of my summer - it requires stamina in the form of looking and exploring and is rewarded by plenty of thought provoking visual inspiration. It’s always great to see how briefs’, trends and themes can be so diversely explored and how subjectivity plays a major role in how it’s received - although some work just has that wow factor for everyone.</p>

<p>And then with MA shows, and showcases such as ‘One Year On’ - these can present work that’s maybe more commercial, or that shows products, materials or processes that are the culmination of a more lengthy exploration.</p>

<p>Key for me is not to get saturated by trying to see everything – being selective and allowing yourself time to look and explore the unexpected is more rewarding and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Some of my favourites this year were the animation at the Royal College of Art, some textiles from the Edinburgh College of Art and some of the ceramics at Central Saint Martins.</p>
    
<p>Now to publications!</p>

<p>And Red Engine Publishing is now a stand-alone publishing brand.</p>

<p>The first addition to the brand’s portfolio is a ‘Bowie By O’Neill – Second Edition’.  This is the ‘Bowie By O’Neill’ book, just with no limited edition prints or signed certificate, but still limited to just 500 copies. Quite a few have already been tempted by this brilliant edition.</p>

<p>We are also working on ‘So It Goes’ a new photographic art book, due out at the end of the year. Please visit our publishing site link here if you’d like to receive project updates. </p>

<p>And in an ever-competitive print market, we’ve been sourcing new suppliers to enable us to offer competitive prices on formats that are undersized A4 – working with specialists in Germany, Sweden and Denmark. A great opportunity and reason to put us to the test!</p>

<p>Time to enjoy the rest of the summer!</p>
