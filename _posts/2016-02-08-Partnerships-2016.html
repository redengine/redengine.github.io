<p>It was suggested I could bring a Valentines' theme into this month's blog. But me being me I couldn't bring myself to go down a predictable or sugar-coated route - even a brief look at the history of the day didn't get me inspired either.<p>


<p>So, I decided to look at the celebrated design partnership of Charles and Ray Eames - my tenuous romantic link is with them being a couple as well as business partners - my take on the Valentines' theme!!!</p>

<p>I'm a big admirer of their work across architecture, graphics, furniture and education... They also used film and photography extensively and there were some lovely examples of both at the Barbican recently.  I was particularly taken with the black and white images documenting the construction of their Los Angeles house, accompanied by some exquisite architectural drawings. But I just love Modernist Architecture anyway.<p>

<p>One of my favourite images of Charles and Ray Eames can be seen <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/611053/charles-eames-advice-for-students/55004b58e58ece792b0000be-charles-and-ray-eame" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">here </a><p>

<p>My lasting impression was of how productive and creative they were - and then the attention to detail, with layouts for graphic design, magazine covers and print. It's a great example of problem solving and teamwork and the power and creative genius that can be produced by creative collaboration - a lifetime of living and designing together. The power of sharing!!!<p>
 
<p>Love this Charles Eames quote "Eventually everything connects - people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se."</p>

<br><p>And here's what we've been up to as a team!!!<p>

<p>We've been creating some short edits to highlight ways you can attract custom and stand out from the crowd. Combining great images with great ideas gets you noticed.<p>

<p>Adding images can really bring what you want to say to life as these examples demonstrate. Images and text together is also a really effective way to tell stories and communicate messages.<p>
