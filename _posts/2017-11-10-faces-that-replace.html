<p>Kevin Cummins’ exhibition, ‘Faces That Replace the Darkness: Punk in Manchester 1977-79', is on at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, until Saturday 18th November – and well worth a visit if you’re in the area.</p>

<p>This body of work is being shown alongside the Theatre’s new production of “Jubillee’.</p>

<p>Cummins also worked with the Theatre as their production photographer between 1978-87, and recently on some of their more current promotional imagery. </p>

<p>‘Kevin Cummins was Manchester’s premier documenter of the punk scene. He graduated from Salford University as punk took its first faltering steps…’ The Royal Exchange Theatre</p>

<p>“I didn’t walk straight into a job. I shot the Punk scene in and around Manchester because it was exciting alt- youth culture movement. I then got the chance to submit some photos to the NME (New Musical Express) and I've continued to shoot musicians all my career.” Kevin Cummins</p>
