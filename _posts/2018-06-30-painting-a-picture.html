<p>We are exited to share our latest project with you - a new book with the brilliant artist George Underwood.</p>

<p>His paintings are figurative in feel but derived from imagination - beautifully haunting with a sort of mythical realism and conceptual narrative. We hope these two images (which I’m particularly drawn to) will whet your appetite.</p>

<p>Images: ‘You Lookin at Me' (left) and ‘Ride With Stripes’ (right).</p>

<p>A love for music led George Underwood to initially pursue a career in the music business, and to make a record with his lifelong friend David Bowie, and another as a solo artist.</p>

<p>He then changed direction and returned to his art, working initially as a commercial illustrator and then as a freelance artist. Still retaining links with the music business he produced artworks for T Rex’s first album, and for Bowie’s Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust albums’. His work includes books, CD covers, adverts, portraits, drawings, paintings... with his paintings held in many private collections around the world.</p>
