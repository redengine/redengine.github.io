<p>The 'Bowie by O'Neill' project so far.</p>

<p>We've put our traditional book publishing expertise to work and have collaborated with Iconic Images, who specialise in iconic people by iconic photographers - and together we have produced 'Bowie by O'Neill'.</p> 

<p>'Bowie by O'Neill' is a unique collector's edition 500-copy limited luxury fine-art book of Terry O'Neill's photography archive of David Bowie, featuring largely unseen images.</p>

<p>It's being published in September, and over the next few weeks we'll be sharing some tasters and highlights of this iconic book's production and contents with you - just enough to whet your appetite that is.</p>
