<p>We spent two full days at World Travel Market this year. Lots of networking and fact finding, moving between the aisles and getting a good feel for what the world of travel looks like in 2014.</p>

<p>I was particularly struck by the amount of video content on the stands, compared to previous years. The demand for rich media content has reached news levels this year, with the travel industry clearly becoming more and more reliant on using video to showcase their products to the world. This includes Constantinou Bros Hotels, who were featuring a video we produced for them on their stand. After all, we know that whilst only 20% of people remember what they read, 80% remember what they see and hear.</p>

<p>Another clear sign of the importance of digital to the world of travel, was the planned auction of the domain name www.holiday.com at WTM, even though it was subsequently postponed. But we will be keeping a close eye on this, as it is expected to go for £20m.</p>

<p>However, whilst the travel sector is clearly fully immersed in the world of digital, there is still a strong place for print. From brochures, to leaflets, to business cards, to signage, for every video I saw, I saw even more printed material. The key here, is the relationship that print collateral and digital collateral hold with one another. And the best stands clearly understood that.</p> 

<p>We also attended one of the talks - Video Blogging and the future of travel content creation. A key takeout point was the fact that whilst bloggers might always have a place as experts, there is a continued surge of user generated content taking force. It is important for brands to embrace this through social media led call to actions, within a clear campaign strategy.</p> 

<p>All in all a great show and we look forward to WTM 2015!</p>
